![cards](Cards.png)

A framework for display and deck building on the command-line.

I used to play Magic when it was new along with Rage and some other CCGs and even was the subject for a card in the Arcadia card game. Now that I'm a parent, I taught my daughter Magic and plan to use this as a gateway to programming.

Someday I may even integrate matchmaking and basic game mechanics.

Installation
